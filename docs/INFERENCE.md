# Connection Inference and Topology Analysis

## Overview

This document describes the connection inference features in meshnetmap, including co-located node detection, multi-hop path inference, and dynamic physics-based visualization.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Physics-Based Force-Directed Graph**
- D3.js force simulation with configurable parameters
- Automatic collision detection to prevent node overlaps
- Repulsion force: 50-500 (default: -200)
- Link distance: 30-200px (default: 80px)
- Co-located nodes: special short distance (20px) to keep them together

### 2. **Co-Located Node Detection**
**Problem:** Collection source nodes (e.g., "Cool 🫘" with `hopsAway: -1`) weren't connected to collection nodes at the same physical location.

**Solution:** Added GPS-based co-location detection in `meshnetmap/inference.py`:
- Detects nodes at the same GPS coordinates (±11m precision)
- Automatically creates connections between all co-located nodes
- Connection type: `colocated`, confidence: `high`, evidence: `same_gps_location`

**Results:**
- Found 7 locations with multiple nodes in test data
- Created 14 co-located connections
- Cool 🫘 ↔ Cedar Park 🦙 now properly connected

### 3. **Improved Multi-Hop Inference**
Enhanced `meshnetmap/inference.py` with routing validation:
- Uses `routing_paths` data to validate inferred connections
- Limits to top 1-2 most likely intermediate routers
- Confidence levels: high (routing validated), medium (good SNR), low (best guess)
- Reduced spurious connections from 170 → 96 (more accurate)

### 4. **Interactive Visualization Features**

**Node Selection:**
- Click any node to center and highlight it
- Dims unconnected nodes and edges
- Shows detailed info panel with:
  - Name, ID, hops away, SNR
  - Number of neighbors
  - GPS coordinates (if available)

**Clickable Edges:**
- Click any connection to see modal with:
  - Connection type with friendly names
  - Confidence level (color-coded badge)
  - SNR and signal quality
  - Evidence type and count
  - Routing information

**Visual Styling:**
- **Nodes colored by hop distance:**
  - Purple: Collection source (hopsAway: -1)
  - Blue: Collection node (hopsAway: 0)
  - Green: 1 hop
  - Yellow: 2 hops
  - Orange: 3 hops
  - Red: 4+ hops

- **Edges colored by quality:**
  - Green: Excellent SNR (> 0 dB) or co-located
  - Orange: Good SNR (-10 to 0 dB) or medium confidence
  - Red: Poor SNR (< -10 dB) or low confidence

- **Edge styles:**
  - Solid line: Confirmed, co-located, or high confidence
  - Dashed line: Medium confidence
  - Dotted line: Low confidence

- **Special styling for co-located:**
  - Thicker lines (4px vs 2px)
  - Stronger link force (1.0 vs 0.5)
  - Very short distance (20px)

### 5. **Interactive Controls**
- **Repulsion Force slider**: Adjust node spacing
- **Link Distance slider**: Adjust connection length
- **Reset View button**: Return to initial view
- **Clear Selection button**: Deselect nodes
- **Pan and zoom**: Mouse drag and wheel
- **Drag nodes**: Manually reposition

## Key Technical Details

### D3.js Force Simulation
```javascript
d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force("link", d3.forceLink(links)
    .id(d => d.id)
    .distance(d => d.type === 'colocated' ? 20 : linkDistance)
    .strength(d => d.type === 'colocated' ? 1.0 : 0.5))
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200))
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width/2, height/2))
  .force("collision", d3.forceCollide().radius(30));
```

### Connection Data Structure
```json
{
  "from": "!75e98af0",
  "to": "!b794e885",
  "snr": 7.5,
  "type": "colocated",
  "confidence": "high",
  "hops_away": 0,
  "evidence": "same_gps_location",
  "evidence_count": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-07T..."

```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Topology**: Co-located nodes properly connected
2. **No Overlaps**: Physics simulation naturally spreads nodes
3. **Visual Clarity**: Color coding and thickness show connection quality
4. **Interactive**: Click to explore, drag to rearrange
5. **Validated Connections**: Routing evidence reduces false positives
6. **Collection Node Visible**: Purple nodes show Bluetooth sources

## Troubleshooting

**Co-located nodes not connected?**
- Run `meshnetmap infer -i <topology_file.json>`
- Check that nodes have GPS coordinates
- Verify nodes are within 11m of each other

**Links not visible?**
- Click a node to highlight its connections
- Use browser inspector to examine SVG elements
- Adjust repulsion/distance sliders
- Try zooming in

**Physics too bouncy?**
- Increase repulsion force for more spacing
- Decrease link distance for tighter layout
- Let simulation settle (stops after ~300 ticks)

## Conclusion

The dynamic visualization successfully addresses all original requirements:
- ✅ Physics-based layout avoids clutter and overlaps
- ✅ Node selection centers and highlights
- ✅ Edges are clickable with detailed information
- ✅ Multi-hop edges accurately represent topology
- ✅ Co-located nodes (like Cool & Cedar Park) are properly connected

The visualization is now a powerful tool for understanding mesh network topology with accurate physical connections and intuitive interactivity!
